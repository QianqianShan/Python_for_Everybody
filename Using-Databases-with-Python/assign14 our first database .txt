Chapter 14: Our first database
Instructions
If you don't already have it, install the SQLite Browser from http://sqlitebrowser.org/.
Then, create a SQLITE database or use an existing database and create a table in the database called "Ages":
CREATE TABLE Ages (    name VARCHAR(128),    age INTEGER ) 
Then make sure the table is empty by deleting any rows that you previously inserted, and insert these rows and only these rows with the following commands:
DELETE FROM Ages; INSERT INTO Ages (name, age) VALUES ('Natania', 33); INSERT INTO Ages (name, age) VALUES ('Zakary', 27); INSERT INTO Ages (name, age) VALUES ('Maanav', 39); INSERT INTO Ages (name, age) VALUES ('Rubie', 37); INSERT INTO Ages (name, age) VALUES ('Erik', 29); 
Once the inserts are done, run the following SQL command:
SELECT hex(name || age) AS X FROM Ages ORDER BY X 
Find the first row in the resulting record set and enter the long string that looks like 53656C696E613333.
Note: This assignment must be done using SQLite - in particular, the SELECT query above will not work in any other database. So you cannot use MySQL or Oracle for this assignment.
